# Quantum Computing 
A quantum computer is a machine that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations; instead of using bits and logic gates as current compters, quantum computers use qubits and quantum gates. Qubit is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.

Areas where **Quantum Computing** can help: 
- Optimization 
- Chemistry 
- Encryption
- Security
- Operations

## Why Quantum Computing work? 
- Superposition    
- Entanglement

## What can we do with Quantum Computers ? 
We can write algorithms using Quantum Computers to solve these complex problems which work on 2^N qbit scale to solve the problems 

## Quantum supremacy
John Preskill has introduced this term *quantum supremacy* to refer to the hypothetical speedup advantage that a quantum computer would have over a classical computers.

# Tools

## Cirq
Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and then running them against quantum computers and simulators. Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of abstracting them away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum *(NISQ)* regime, these details determine whether or not it is possible to execute a circuit at all.

## Qiskit 
Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.
A central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also aims to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing quantum computation today.

## Things to Learn 
1. Quantum Gates and Circuits
2. Qubits, Bloch Sphere and Basis States 
3. Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm 
4. Multiple Qubits and Entanglement 


## Key features
- Superposition: The ability of a quantum bit (qubit) to exist in multiple states simultaneously.
- Entanglement: The phenomenon where the state of one qubit is correlated with the state of another, even at great distances.
- Interference: The ability of quantum systems to interfere with each other, which can be harnessed for quantum algorithms.
- Amplitude amplification: A technique used in quantum algorithms to amplify the probability of the desired outcome.
- Quantum parallelism: The ability of a quantum computer to perform multiple calculations at once, due to the superposition and entanglement of qubits.
- Quantum tunneling: The ability of quantum systems to tunnel through potential barriers, which can be used for quantum optimization algorithms.
- No cloning theorem: The principle that it is impossible to perfectly copy an unknown quantum state, which has implications for quantum cryptography.
