# Quantum Computing 
A quantum computer is a machine that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations; instead of using bits and logic gates as current compters, quantum computers use qubits and quantum gates. Qubit is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.

Areas where Quantum Computing can help: 
- Optimization 
- Chemistry 
- Encryption

## Why Quantum Computing work? 
- Superposition    
- Entanglement


## What can we do with Quantum Computers ? 
We can write algorithms using Quantum Computers to solve these complex problems which work on 2^N qbit scale to solve the problems 

# Tools

## Cirq
Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and then running them against quantum computers and simulators. Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of abstracting them away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime, these details determine whether or not it is possible to execute a circuit at all.

## Qiskit 
Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.
A central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also aims to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing quantum computation today.
